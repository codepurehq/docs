# What it is
Codepure’s Container Security feature scans your Docker images and containerized applications for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and outdated software packages. This ensures that your containers are secure before they are deployed to production.

# How it works
When you run a Container Security scan, Codepure analyzes:

* Base images – checks if the underlying OS or framework has known vulnerabilities.

* Installed packages – scans all packages and dependencies inside the container.

* Configuration files – detects risky settings like running as root or exposing unnecessary ports.

* Secrets in images – flags any hardcoded passwords, API keys, or tokens.

# Why it’s important
Containers are lightweight and portable, but they can also introduce security risks if not regularly scanned. Container Security helps you:

* Prevent vulnerabilities from reaching production.

* Detect misconfigurations that could be exploited by attackers.

* Ensure compliance with security standards like CIS Docker Benchmark, OWASP, and ISO 27001.

# Example: Running a Container Security Scan

3. Fix the Vulnerability (Remediation)

* Click Open on an Issue to view details.

* On the right-hand side, you’ll see the Remediation section with instructions, such as updating the base image or removing unnecessary privileges.

* Apply the fix in your container configuration, then change the status to Fixed in Codepure.
