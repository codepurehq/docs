<Steps>
  <Step title="Select an Issue">
    - Go to the [issues](https://corgea.app/issues) page.
    - Click on an issue that has a fix that is ready you'd like to resolve.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/fix-status.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the fix">
    Corgea puts rigious controls and checks to ensure fixes are of the highest quality. However, we do recommend reviewing the quality of the fix as they are AI generated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply the fix">
    If the fix seems appropriate, there are two ways to apply fixes:
    - **Option 1**: Corgea Web Application 

      Click on the "Fix Issue" and then on the "Issue PR" button. 
      <Tip>To issue a pull-request from Corgea, you need to setup the appropriate integration with [GitHub](github) or [Azure DevOps](azure_devops).</Tip>
      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/fix-issue.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
      </Frame>
      Corgea will automatically issue a pull-request with a description of the issue, and a description of the fix. It will tag the last committer to the file as a reviewer

      Alternatively, users can download the Git diff or the full fixed file by clicking on the "Git Patch" or "Fixed File" options.
    
    - **Option 2**: Corgea IDE Extensions

      Corgea supports applying fixes locally using our IDE extensions. Corgea supports [Visual Studio Code](vsc_extension) and [Visual Studio 2022](vs2022_extension) IDE extensions.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Optionally: Vote on the fix">
    If the fix is good or bad, please leave a vote, and ideally a comment. We review your feedback and use it to make Corgea better, so we greatly appreciate them.
