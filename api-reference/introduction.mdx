# Corgea CLI API Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Corgea CLI API Documentation. This API enables you to interact with the Corgea platform programmatically, allowing for various operations such as verifying tokens, uploading scans, managing issues, and more. Below you will find a comprehensive guide to all available endpoints, including the necessary parameters, request bodies, and responses.

## Base URL

All endpoints referenced in this documentation have the following base URL:

```
https://corgea.app/api/
