The Corgea CLI is a command-line interface that allows users to upload vulnerability data and code snippets to Corgea for fixing. It provides a convenient way to interact with the Corgea platform and streamline the process of identifying and resolving vulnerabilities in software projects.

## Install with PIP

To install the Corgea CLI tool, you can use Python's package installer, pip. Open your terminal and run the following command: 

    ```bash
    pip install corgea-cli
    ```

 This command fetches the Corgea CLI package from PyPI (Python Package Index) and installs it on your system. You can find more details about the package on its PyPI page: https://pypi.org/project/corgea-cli/.
