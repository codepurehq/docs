## Extensive Vulnerability Database

At Corgea, we understand the importance of comprehensive vulnerability coverage to ensure the security of your applications. Our AI-powered platform offers extensive coverage, addressing approximately 900 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) across various programming languages and frameworks.

While industry standards like the OWASP Top 10 and the Top 25 CWEs provide valuable guidance, we believe in going beyond these lists to offer a more comprehensive solution. Our approach is to continuously expand our vulnerability database, staying ahead of emerging threats and addressing a wide range of security issues.

## Depth and Breadth of Coverage

Corgea's vulnerability coverage spans multiple dimensions, ensuring that your codebase is thoroughly analyzed for potential security risks. Our platform covers:

1. **Language-Specific Vulnerabilities**: We understand the nuances of different programming languages and their unique security challenges. Our AI models are trained to identify vulnerabilities specific to languages like C#, Python, Ruby, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Java, among others.

2. **Framework-Specific Vulnerabilities**: Popular frameworks within each language often introduce their own set of security concerns. Corgea's analysis takes into account the intricacies of frameworks like .NET, Django, Ruby on Rails, Gin, Express.js, and Spring, providing targeted vulnerability detection and remediation.

3. **Cross-Language Vulnerabilities**: In addition to language-specific issues, our platform addresses vulnerabilities that can occur across multiple languages, such as insecure cryptographic practices, improper input validation, and race conditions.

4. **Emerging Threats**: Our AI models are continuously updated to stay ahead of the curve, ensuring that we can detect and address new vulnerabilities as they emerge in the ever-evolving security landscape.

## Importance of Comprehensive Coverage

Comprehensive vulnerability coverage is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Reduced Risk**: By addressing a wide range of vulnerabilities, Corgea helps minimize the risk of security breaches, data leaks, and other potential threats to your applications.

2. **Compliance**: Many industries and regulatory bodies have specific security requirements. Corgea's extensive coverage helps ensure compliance with these standards, reducing the risk of non-compliance penalties.

3. **Efficiency**: With our AI-powered false positive detection and automated fixing capabilities, Corgea streamlines the security review process, saving your team valuable time and resources.

4. **Continuous Improvement**: By continuously expanding our vulnerability database and incorporating new threats, Corgea ensures that your applications remain secure as the security landscape evolves.
