title: Apply Security Context to Your Pods and Containers (CIS 5.6.3)
description: Enforce defense-in-depth by explicitly defining security settings for all workloads
---

## Impact & Risk Analysis

* **Severity:** Medium (Level 2 - Defense in Depth)
* **CIS Benchmark:** CIS 5.6.3
* **Impact:** **Insecure Defaults.** A security context defines privilege and access control settings for a Pod or Container. Without an explicit security context, Kubernetes relies on the container runtime's defaults, which often include running as `root`, having unnecessary Linux capabilities, and allowing write access to the root filesystem. This significantly increases the attack surface if the application is compromised.

## Common Misconfiguration

Omitting the `securityContext` section entirely in Deployment or Pod manifests. This is the most common default state for new deployments, leaving the application running with permissions it likely does not need.

## Vulnerable Example

```yaml
# Vulnerable Pod Spec
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: insecure-pod
spec:
  # VULNERABLE: No Pod-level security context
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nginx
    # VULNERABLE: No Container-level security context
    # Result: Runs as root, with writable root FS, and default capabilities.

```

## Secure Example

```yaml
# Secure Pod Spec
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secure-pod
spec:
  # 1. Pod-Level Context (Applies to all containers)
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    runAsGroup: 3000
    runAsNonRoot: true
    fsGroup: 2000
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault
      
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nginx
    # 2. Container-Level Context (Overrides/Supplements Pod level)
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      capabilities:
        drop:
          - ALL

```

## Audit Procedure

Review the pod definitions in your cluster and verify that security contexts are defined. You can use this command to find pods that lack a security context entirely or have specific missing fields.

```bash
# Check for pods with missing security contexts
kubectl get pods -A -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}: {.spec.securityContext} {.spec.containers[*].securityContext}{"\n"}{end}'

```

* **Analyze:** Look for empty brackets `{}` or missing critical fields like `runAsNonRoot` or `capabilities`.
* **Fail:** If the output indicates `null` or empty configurations for user workloads.

## Remediation

Apply a robust `securityContext` to all your Pods and Containers.

1. **Pod Level:** Set `runAsNonRoot`, `runAsUser`, and `fsGroup` to ensure identity isolation.
2. **Container Level:** Set `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, and drop `ALL` capabilities to harden the runtime environment.
