## A letter from the Corgea team

Welcome to Corgea, 

Corgea is an AI-powered code security platform that helps you find, and fix insecure code; in developer terms, it is an **AI-powered vulnerability linter**. We decided to build Corgea because we saw that application security tools were meant for security teams, which doesn't make sense to us since devs are resposible to secure their apps. 

We decided to build Corgea as a dev-tool for every software engineer to increase security with the best dev-experience. To meet this promise, Corgea's findings and fixes need to be precise, understandable, integrated into developer workflows and not noisy. 

What makes Corgea special is the use of LLMs and static code analysis to surface and fix hard find vulnerabilities like business logic, authentication and programming vulnerabilities. 

We're excited to have you here, and for you to join our journey. 

Sincerely, 

[The Corgea Team](https://corgea.com/about)

## What can Corgea do? 
1. **Find vulnerabilities**: Corgea's BLAST can find business logic, authentication and code vulnerabilities.
2. **AI-Powered Remediation**: The AI engine analyzes these vulnerabilities and generates appropriate fixes.
3. **Vulnerability Consumption**: Corgea can consume vulnerability reports from integrated SAST tools to detect false positives, and fix the vulnerabilities.
