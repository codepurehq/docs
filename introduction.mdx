## A Message from the Codepure Team


Welcome to Codepure,
We built Codepure to help developers and security teams work together to secure applications without slowing down development.

Codepure offers a complete set of application security tools, including:

* Static Application Security Testing (SAST) – find vulnerabilities in your source code.

* Software Composition Analysis (SCA) – detect risks in open-source libraries and generate an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for full component visibility.

* Container Security – scan Docker images for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

* Secret Scanning – find exposed passwords, API keys, and sensitive data in your code.

# What makes Codepure different?

* All our security engines are developed in C++23 for maximum speed and efficiency.

* You get faster scan results without sacrificing accuracy — security checks won’t slow your workflow.

We know how important it is to keep your process seamless. That’s why Codepure integrates directly into your development pipeline, giving you actionable insights and clear remediation steps with minimal disruption.

Using modern static analysis techniques and intelligent algorithms, Codepure can detect vulnerabilities such as:

* SQL Injection

* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

* Path Traversal

* Weak encryption

* Authentication flaws

* Container misconfigurations

* Exposed secrets

We’re excited to have you here and look forward to helping you build safer, more reliable applications.

— The Codepure Team
