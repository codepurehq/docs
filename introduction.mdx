## A Message from the Codepure Team

Welcome to Codepure,

Codepure is a cutting-edge application security platform designed to empower developers and security teams alike. Our tools provide robust **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**, **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**, and **SBOM generation**, ensuring applications remain secure and compliant.

We built Codepure because we understand the challenges developers face in securing their code while maintaining seamless workflows. Codepure integrates directly into your development pipeline, offering actionable insights and fixes without disrupting your productivity.

What sets Codepure apart is its powerful combination of modern static analysis techniques and intelligent algorithms that detect vulnerabilities, such as insecure configurations, weak encryption, and authentication flaws.

We're thrilled to have you join us on this journey toward creating safer and more reliable software.

Sincerely,

[The Codepure Team](https://codepure.com/about)
