## A Message from the Codepure Team

Welcome to Codepure,

Codepure is an advanced application security platform built to support developers and security teams in securing their applications. Our platform includes powerful tools for **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**, **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**, and **SBOM generation** to help ensure your software is secure and compliant.

What makes Codepure unique is that all our engines are written in **C++23**, providing faster and more efficient analysis compared to other solutions. This performance boost means you get security results quicker without slowing down your development workflow.

We understand how important it is to keep your work seamless. Thatâ€™s why Codepure integrates directly into your development pipeline, providing actionable insights and fixes with minimal disruption to your process.

Our technology combines modern static analysis techniques with intelligent algorithms to detect vulnerabilities like insecure configurations, weak encryption, and authentication flaws, making it an essential tool for building secure software.

We are excited to have you here and look forward to helping you create safer and more reliable applications.

Sincerely,  
The Codepure Team
