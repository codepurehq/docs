# Roles and Permissions  

Codepure’s **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is designed to support secure collaboration between security teams and developers. It ensures that each role has only the necessary access to perform their tasks while maintaining strong governance over security workflows.

## 🔑 **Role Descriptions**

### **Admin**
- Has **full control** over Codepure.
- Can manage **users, roles, integrations, and system-wide settings**.
- Can create and manage all projects.
- Can run scans, approve vulnerabilities, assign fixes, and manage all permissions.
- Intended for **platform owners or security leads**.

### **AppSec (Application Security Analyst)**
- Can **create and import projects** from integrations or local sources.
- Can **run scans** and **see all projects** in the organization.
- Reviews vulnerabilities reported by the system.
- After a developer marks a vulnerability as **fixed** or **false positive**, AppSec can **approve or reject** that status.
- Can **assign specific projects** to developers for verification and fixing vulnerabilities.
- Cannot manage users, roles, or integrations.

### **Developer**
- Has access **only to projects assigned to them**.
- Can view vulnerabilities for assigned projects.
- Can **verify vulnerabilities** by marking them as:
  - ✅ **Fixed** (after applying a code fix), or
  - 🚫 **False Positive**.
- Cannot run scans, approve vulnerabilities, or access other projects.
- Intended for **software engineers** working on fixing security findings.

## ⚙️ **How to Assign Roles and Projects**

1. Navigate to **User Management** in the Codepure dashboard.
2. Assign the role (**Admin**, **AppSec**, or **Developer**) to a user.
3. For developers, select specific projects to grant access.
4. Click **Save** to apply changes.

---

## 🛡️ **Best Practices**

- Keep **Admin** access limited to security leads.
- Use **AppSec** roles for dedicated security engineers managing scans and vulnerability approvals.
- Assign **Developers** only the projects they work on to maintain the principle of least privilege.
- Regularly review role assignments and project access to ensure compliance and security integrity.
