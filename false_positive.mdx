Codepure leverages advanced AI and machine learning models to analyze potential vulnerabilities and determine their likelihood of being false positives.



Our AI model evaluates factors such as code context, vulnerability patterns, and best practices to provide clear results: whether a vulnerability is "valid" or a "false positive." Additionally, it explains the reasoning behind its determination to help developers make informed decisions.


By combining false positive detection with vulnerability explanations and actionable fixes, Codepure helps developers focus on real security threats, saving time and effort.

## Common False Positives Detected by Codepure

Codepure is designed to identify and eliminate false positives across a wide range of security issues, including:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Determines if input is properly sanitized or encoded using secure libraries or frameworks.  
- **SQL Injection**: Verifies the use of parameterized queries or prepared statements without exploitable input.  
- **Information Exposure**: Identifies if sensitive information leaks are confined to development environments or contain non-critical data.  
- **Uncaught Exceptions**: Detects if alternative handling mechanisms like logging or monitoring are in place.  
- **Hard-Coded Passwords**: Ensures credentials are limited to test environments or automated pipelines.  
- **Configuration File Passwords**: Confirms secure measures like encryption or access control for stored plaintext passwords.  
- **Hard-Coded Cryptographic Keys**: Recognizes cryptographic keys used exclusively for testing purposes.  
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Validates the presence of anti-CSRF mechanisms or determines if the context (e.g., APIs) makes CSRF irrelevant.  
- **Missing Integrity Checks**: Identifies alternative methods, such as digital signatures or hash validations, ensuring data integrity.  
- **Hard-Coded Credentials**: Detects credentials intended for development or QA environments.  
- **Code Injection**: Confirms if injection points are isolated to secure or controlled environments.  

Codepureâ€™s ability to accurately distinguish between real vulnerabilities and false positives empowers development teams to prioritize their efforts and improve security efficiency.
