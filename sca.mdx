# What it is
Codepure’s Software Composition Analysis (SCA) scans your project’s dependencies to find vulnerabilities in open-source libraries and third-party components. Many modern applications rely heavily on external packages, and if these contain security flaws, your application can be at risk.

# How it works
When you run an SCA scan, Codepure analyzes your project’s dependency files (such as package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, etc.) and compares them against vulnerability databases. It identifies:

* Vulnerable dependencies – packages with known security issues.

* Outdated libraries – older versions that may no longer receive security patches.

* License risks – open-source licenses that might cause legal compliance issues.

# Why it’s important
Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries are one of the top causes of security breaches. SCA helps you:

* Reduce supply chain risks by identifying and updating unsafe dependencies.

* Stay compliant with security standards like OWASP, PCI DSS, NIST, and ISO 27001.

* Save time by getting direct recommendations for safe versions.

# SBOM – Software Bill of Materials
# What it is
Every time you run an SCA scan, Codepure automatically generates a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). An SBOM is a detailed list of every software component in your project — including open-source libraries, frameworks, and their versions.

# Why it matters
An SBOM gives you full visibility into your project’s software supply chain, making it easier to:

* Track all dependencies and their versions.

* Monitor vulnerabilities over time.

* Prove compliance with regulations such as NIST and ISO 27001.

* Respond quickly to new security advisories affecting your components.

# Example: Running a SCA Scan

1. Select and Scan

* From the dashboard, select the project you want to scan.

* Choose SCA and click Start Scanning.
