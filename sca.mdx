## Overview

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a critical security practice that automatically identifies and manages open-source components and third-party dependencies in your codebase. Codepure's SCA solution provides comprehensive visibility into your software supply chain, helping you identify vulnerabilities, license risks, and outdated components before they become security incidents.

## What is SCA?

Codepure's Software Composition Analysis scans your entire dependency tree to identify security vulnerabilities, licensing issues, and quality concerns in open-source libraries and third-party components. With modern applications containing up to 90% open-source code, SCA has become essential for maintaining secure and compliant software.

### Key Capabilities

- **Deep Dependency Analysis**: Scans both direct and transitive dependencies
- **Real-time Vulnerability Detection**: Continuously monitors against multiple vulnerability databases
- **License Compliance Management**: Identifies potential licensing conflicts and risks
- **Automated SBOM Generation**: Creates comprehensive Software Bill of Materials for every scan
- **Remediation Guidance**: Provides actionable fix recommendations with upgrade paths

## How It Works

### Scanning Process

Codepure's SCA engine employs a multi-stage analysis approach:

1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Automatically detects and parses dependency manifests (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, go.mod, Gemfile, etc.)
   - Identifies all direct and transitive dependencies
   - Maps the complete dependency tree

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - Compares dependencies against multiple vulnerability databases (NVD, GitHub Advisory Database, OSV, etc.)
   - Performs license compatibility analysis
   - Checks for outdated or deprecated packages
   - Evaluates dependency health metrics

3. **Reporting Phase**
   - Generates detailed vulnerability reports with CVSS scores
   - Produces automated SBOM documentation
   - Provides prioritized remediation recommendations
   - Creates compliance reports for regulatory requirements

### Supported Ecosystems

Codepure SCA supports all major package managers and dependency formats:

- **JavaScript/Node.js**: npm, yarn, pnpm
- **Python**: pip, pipenv, poetry
- **Java**: Maven, Gradle
- **.NET**: NuGet
- **Ruby**: Bundler
- **Go**: Go modules
- **PHP**: Composer
- **Rust**: Cargo
- **Container**: Docker, OCI images

## Why SCA is Critical

### Security Benefits

**Supply Chain Protection**
- Third-party dependencies account for over 70% of modern codebases
- A single vulnerable dependency can compromise your entire application
- Attackers increasingly target popular open-source packages

**Proactive Risk Management**
- Identify vulnerabilities before they reach production
- Get alerts for newly discovered CVEs affecting your dependencies
- Understand the exploitability and impact of each vulnerability

**Compliance Requirements**
- Meet regulatory standards (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)
- Satisfy customer security questionnaires
- Demonstrate due diligence in software security

### Business Impact

- **Reduce Security Debt**: Address vulnerabilities systematically before they accumulate
- **Accelerate Development**: Automated scanning eliminates manual security reviews
- **Lower Remediation Costs**: Fix issues early when they're less expensive to address
- **Improve Customer Trust**: Demonstrate commitment to security best practices

## Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

### What is an SBOM?

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a comprehensive inventory of all software components in your application. Like a list of ingredients on food packaging, an SBOM provides transparency into your software's composition.

### SBOM Components

Every Codepure-generated SBOM includes:

- **Component Identification**
  - Package name and version
  - Publisher/author information
  - Download location and checksums
  
- **Dependency Relationships**
  - Direct vs. transitive dependencies
  - Dependency tree visualization
  - Version constraints and conflicts

- **Security Information**
  - Known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
  - CVSS scores and severity ratings
  - Available patches and updates

- **License Details**
  - License types for each component
  - License compatibility analysis
  - Compliance obligations

### SBOM Formats

Codepure supports industry-standard SBOM formats:
- **SPDX**: Software Package Data Exchange
- **CycloneDX**: Full-stack bill of materials standard
- **JSON/CSV**: Custom formats for integration

### Why SBOMs Matter

**Regulatory Compliance**
- Required by Executive Order 14028 for federal software suppliers
- Mandated by FDA for medical device software
- Expected by EU Cyber Resilience Act

**Incident Response**
- Quickly identify affected systems when new vulnerabilities emerge
- Accelerate patching and remediation efforts
- Provide transparency to customers and stakeholders

**Supply Chain Security**
- Track component provenance
- Monitor for suspicious changes
- Validate software integrity
