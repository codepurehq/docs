## What is Codepure SAST?

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is a "white-box" security testing method that scans your application's source code to find vulnerabilities *before* it's ever run.

Codepure's SAST engine integrates directly into your development workflow, acting like a security-focused linter for your entire codebase. It analyzes the code paths, data flows, and configurations to identify dangerous coding patterns and flaws that could lead to a breach.

## The "Shift Left" Advantage

By integrating SAST early in your development lifecycle (a practice known as "shifting left"), you ensure that security is built into your code from the start, not bolted on at the end.

* **Find Flaws Early:** Detect vulnerabilities during the coding phase, long before they can reach production.
* **Lower Remediation Costs:** Fixing a bug is 10-100x cheaper in development than in production.
* **Empower Developers:** Give your team immediate security feedback so they can learn and write more secure code over time.

## What Codepure SAST Finds

Codepure's SAST engine is trained to find a wide variety of vulnerability classes, including many from the **OWASP Top 10**. This provides broad protection against the most common and critical risks.

* **Injection Flaws (A03):** Detects patterns that could lead to [SQL Injection (CWE-89)](/vulnerabilities/sql-injection), [Command Injection (CWE-78)](/vulnerabilities/command-injection), and [EL Injection (CWE-917)](/vulnerabilities/cwe-917).
* **Cryptographic Failures (A02):** Finds weak algorithms like [CWE-327](/vulnerabilities/cwe-327) or hard-coded secrets like [CWE-259](/vulnerabilities/cwe-259).
* **Broken Access Control (A01):** Identifies flaws like [Path Traversal (CWE-22)](/vulnerabilities/path-traversal).
* **Insecure Design (A04):** Catches risky coding patterns like the use of `eval()` or dangerous file uploads ([CWE-434](/vulnerabilities/cwe-434)).
* **Security Misconfiguration (A05):** Discovers issues like disabling security features or insecure XML parsers ([CWE-611](/vulnerabilities/xxe)).

## Dashboard Guide: Running Your First Scan

Running a SAST scan in Codepure is a simple, three-step process.

### Step 1: Start Your Scan

From the dashboard, select the project you want to scan. In the project view, choose **SAST** and click **Start Scanning**.

</Frame>

### Step 2: Triage Vulnerabilities

When the scan finishes, click the project name to go to the results dashboard. Click **Full Result** to view all findings. You can use the filters to sort by severity, file, or vulnerability type (e.g., CWE, OWASP, PCI).

### Step 3: Remediate and Resolve

Click **Open** on any vulnerability to see the in-depth details. On the right-hand side, the **Remediation** tab provides clear, actionable guidance on how to fix the issue, often with secure code examples.

Once you have applied the fix in your source code, you can change the vulnerability's status to **Fixed** in the dashboard.

By following this "Scan, Triage, Remediate" loop, you can systematically reduce your application's security risk with each development cycle.
