# What it is
Codepure’s Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scans your source code to find security issues before your application is deployed. It works during development, helping your team fix problems early when they are easier and cheaper to resolve.

# How it works
SAST analyzes your code without running the application. It checks for dangerous coding patterns and insecure practices. This helps you catch vulnerabilities like:

* SQL Injection – attackers inserting harmful database queries.

* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – injecting malicious scripts into web pages.

* Path Traversal – attackers accessing files or directories outside the intended folder.

# Why it’s important
By integrating SAST early in your development lifecycle (Shift Left), you ensure that security is built into your code from the start. This means:

* Early detection – find vulnerabilities before they reach production.

* Lower cost to fix – address issues during coding instead of after release.

* Improved security – reduce the risk of breaches and data leaks.

# Key benefits of Codepure’s SAST

* Works with multiple programming languages and frameworks.

* Provides clear, actionable guidance for fixing vulnerabilities.

* Supports integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated scanning.

* Helps meet compliance requirements and security standards.

# Example: Running a SAST Scan

1. Select and Scan

* From the dashboard, select the project you want to scan.

* Choose SAST and click Start Scanning.

3. Fix the Vulnerability (Remediation)

* Click Open on a vulnerability to view details.

* On the right-hand side, you’ll see the Remediation section with suggested code changes or instructions.

* Apply the fix in your code, then change the status to Fixed in Codepure.
