## Overview

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is a white-box security testing methodology that analyzes source code, bytecode, or binary code to identify security vulnerabilities without executing the application. Codepure's SAST solution provides deep code analysis capabilities that integrate seamlessly into your development workflow, enabling you to build secure software from the ground up.

## What is SAST?

Codepure's SAST engine performs comprehensive security analysis of your application's source code during the development phase. By examining code structure, data flows, and control flows, SAST identifies security vulnerabilities, quality issues, and compliance violations before they reach production.

### Core Capabilities

- **Deep Code Analysis**: Examines code paths, data flows, and control structures
- **Language-Agnostic Scanning**: Supports 30+ programming languages and frameworks
- **Incremental Scanning**: Analyzes only changed code for faster feedback
- **Custom Rule Engine**: Define organization-specific security policies
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Machine learning models identify complex vulnerability patterns
- **Developer-Friendly Reporting**: Clear, actionable remediation guidance

## How SAST Works

### Analysis Methodology

Codepure SAST employs multiple analysis techniques for comprehensive coverage:

#### 1. **Lexical Analysis**
- Tokenizes source code into meaningful components
- Identifies dangerous functions and deprecated methods
- Detects hardcoded secrets and credentials

#### 2. **Syntactic Analysis**
- Builds Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) of your code
- Validates code structure and patterns
- Identifies anti-patterns and insecure constructs

#### 3. **Semantic Analysis**
- Understands code behavior and intent
- Tracks variable states and transformations
- Analyzes type safety and memory management

#### 4. **Data Flow Analysis**
- Traces data movement through the application
- Identifies tainted data sources
- Tracks data sanitization and validation

#### 5. **Control Flow Analysis**
- Maps all possible execution paths
- Identifies unreachable code and dead ends
- Detects race conditions and timing issues

### Vulnerability Detection Categories

#### **Injection Flaws**
- **SQL Injection**: Unsanitized database queries
- **Command Injection**: OS command execution vulnerabilities
- **LDAP Injection**: Directory service query manipulation
- **XPath Injection**: XML query vulnerabilities
- **NoSQL Injection**: Document database vulnerabilities

#### **Authentication & Session Management**
- Weak password policies
- Insecure session handling
- Missing authentication checks
- Privilege escalation paths
- Broken authentication flows

#### **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Reflected XSS**: Immediate execution vulnerabilities
- **Stored XSS**: Persistent script injection
- **DOM-based XSS**: Client-side script vulnerabilities

#### **Security Misconfiguration**
- Hardcoded credentials
- Insecure default settings
- Verbose error messages
- Unnecessary features enabled
- Missing security headers

#### **Sensitive Data Exposure**
- Unencrypted data transmission
- Weak cryptographic algorithms
- Improper key management
- Data leakage in logs
- Insufficient data masking

#### **Access Control Issues**
- **Path Traversal**: Directory traversal vulnerabilities
- **Insecure Direct Object References**: Unauthorized data access
- **Missing Function Level Access Control**: Unprotected APIs
- **CORS Misconfiguration**: Cross-origin resource sharing issues

#### **Business Logic Flaws**
- Race conditions
- Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU)
- Improper input validation
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Buffer overflows

## Why SAST is Critical

### Security Benefits

  languages: ["java", "python", "javascript"]
  pattern: |
    log.*(password|token|secret|api_key)
  message: "Sensitive data should not be logged"
  remediation: "Remove or mask sensitive data before logging"
