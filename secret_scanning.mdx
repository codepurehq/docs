# What it is
Codepure’s Secret Scanning feature searches your code, configuration files, and commit history for sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, tokens, and private certificates. This helps you prevent accidental exposure of secrets that could be exploited by attackers.

# How it works
When you run a Secret Scanning process, Codepure analyzes:

* Source code files – checks for patterns that match API keys, passwords, and tokens.

* Configuration files – scans files like .env, config.yml, and .dockerfile for sensitive values.

* Commit history – detects if secrets were ever committed to your repository, even if later removed.

* Common secret formats – supports scanning for cloud provider keys, database credentials, encryption keys, and more.

# Why it’s important
Leaked secrets can give attackers direct access to your systems, databases, and cloud services. Secret Scanning helps you:

* Stop security breaches caused by exposed credentials.

* Prevent cloud account takeovers from stolen API keys.

* Maintain compliance with standards like PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and SOC 2.

3. Fix the Exposure (Remediation)

* Click Open on a finding to view details.

* On the right-hand side, you’ll see the Remediation section with instructions, such as removing the secret from code and rotating credentials.

* After applying the fix, change the status to Fixed in Codepure.
