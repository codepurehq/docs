# What it is
Codepure’s Secret Scanning feature searches your code, configuration files, and commit history for sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, tokens, and private certificates. This helps you prevent accidental exposure of secrets that could be exploited by attackers.

# How it works
When you run a Secret Scanning process, Codepure analyzes:

* Source code files – checks for patterns that match API keys, passwords, and tokens.

* Configuration files – scans files like .env, config.yml, and .dockerfile for sensitive values.

* Commit history – detects if secrets were ever committed to your repository, even if later removed.

* Common secret formats – supports scanning for cloud provider keys, database credentials, encryption keys, and more.

# Why it’s important
Leaked secrets can give attackers direct access to your systems, databases, and cloud services. Secret Scanning helps you:

* Stop security breaches caused by exposed credentials.

* Prevent cloud account takeovers from stolen API keys.

* Maintain compliance with standards like PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and SOC 2.

# Example
You import your project from GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket into Codepure. Then, you select the project and run a Secret Scan. Codepure detects that an AWS Access Key is stored in a .env file and also finds a database password in your source code. It alerts you and provides recommendations to rotate the keys and remove them from the codebase.
