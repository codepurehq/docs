## Scanning Django Applications

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Codepure deeply understands Django's "batteries-included" structure.

<Info>
  **Quick Start:** Codepure automatically detects Django projects. We analyze your `requirements.txt`, `settings.py`, `urls.py`, and all application modules.

### How Codepure Scans Django

* **SAST (Static Analysis):** We trace data from `request` objects in your views, understanding Django's URL routing and ORM. This allows us to find vulnerabilities from user input to your models and templates.
* **SCA (Software Composition Analysis):** We scan your `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`, or `pyproject.toml` to find vulnerabilities in your `pip` packages.
* **Secret Scanning:** We scan `settings.py` and `.env` files for your `SECRET_KEY`, database passwords, and cloud API keys.

### Common Vulnerabilities Found

* [A03: Injection](/vulnerabilities/sql-injection) in raw Django ORM queries (`.raw()`, `.extra()`).
* [A03: Injection](/vulnerabilities/xss) in templates that improperly use the `|safe` filter.
* [A05: Security Misconfiguration](/vulnerabilities/cwe-11) such as leaving `DEBUG = True` in a production `settings.py`.
* [A01: Broken Access Control](/vulnerabilities/cwe-352) from missing or misconfigured CSRF tokens.
