## Scanning .NET Applications

.NET (including **ASP.NET Core**) is Microsoft's high-performance, cross-platform framework for building modern web applications and APIs. Codepure provides first-class support for C# and the .NET ecosystem.

<Info>
  **Quick Start:** Codepure automatically detects .NET projects. Just point us at your repository, and we will analyze your `.csproj` files, `appsettings.json`, and C# source code.

### How Codepure Scans .NET

* **SAST (Static Analysis):** Our C# analyzer understands the complete ASP.NET Core framework. We trace data from controller actions and Minimal APIs to database sinks (like Entity Framework Core) and other dangerous APIs.
* **SCA (Software Composition Analysis):** We parse your `.csproj` files and NuGet package references to find vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
* **Secret Scanning:** We scan `appsettings.json`, `appsettings.Development.json`, and `.env` files for connection strings, API keys, and other secrets.

### Common Vulnerabilities Found

* [A01: Broken Access Control](/vulnerabilities/cwe-284) in insecure Controller Action attributes like `[AllowAnonymous]`.
* [A03: Injection](/vulnerabilities/sql-injection) in raw Entity Framework Core queries (`FromSqlRaw`).
* [A05: Security Misconfiguration](/vulnerabilities/cwe-11) such as leaving `EnableDetailedErrors` on in production.
* [A07: Identification and Authentication Failures](/vulnerabilities/cwe-287) from misconfigured JWT or cookie authentication.
