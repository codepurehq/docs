## Scanning Ruby on Rails Applications

Ruby on Rails revolutionized web development with its "convention over configuration" philosophy. Codepure is an expert in Rails and can find deep security flaws in your application.

<Info>
  **Quick Start:** Codepure automatically detects Rails projects. We analyze your `Gemfile`, `config/routes.rb`, controllers, models, and `.erb` templates.

### How Codepure Scans Rails

* **SAST (Static Analysis):** We trace data from the `params` hash through your controllers, models (Active Record), and views. We understand Rails conventions to find flaws with high accuracy.
* **SCA (Software Composition Analysis):** We scan your `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` to find vulnerable Gems (e.g., an old version of Rails itself, or a dependency with a known flaw).
* **Secret Scanning:** We scan `config/database.yml`, `config/credentials.yml.enc`, and `.env` files for secrets. (We will flag any *unencrypted* secrets).

### Common Vulnerabilities Found

* [A03: Injection](/vulnerabilities/sql-injection) in Active Record queries that use string concatenation (`.where("name = '#{params[:name]}'")`).
* [A03: Injection](/vulnerabilities/xss) in `.erb` templates that use `raw()` or `<%= raw ... %>`.
* [A01: Broken Access Control](/vulnerabilities/cwe-352): Mass Assignment vulnerabilities.
* [A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures](/vulnerabilities/deserialization) from insecure YAML loading (`YAML.load`).
