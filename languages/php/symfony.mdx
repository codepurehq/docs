## Scanning Symfony Applications

Symfony is a high-performance set of reusable PHP components and a powerful web framework. Codepure's scanner understands Symfony's complex, component-based architecture.

### How Codepure Scans Symfony

* **SAST (Static Analysis):** We trace data from the `Request` object through your controllers and services. We analyze Doctrine (for database injection) and Twig (for XSS) to find data flow vulnerabilities.
* **SCA (Software Composition Analysis):** We scan your `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files for known vulnerabilities in your Symfony components and other dependencies.
* **Secret Scanning:** We scan `.env` files and `services.yaml` for database connection strings and other secrets.

### Common Vulnerabilities Found

* [A03: Injection](/vulnerabilities/sql-injection) in custom DQL (Doctrine Query Language) or raw SQL queries.
* [A03: Injection](/vulnerabilities/xss) in Twig templates that use the `|raw` filter on user input.
* [A05: Security Misconfiguration](/vulnerabilities/cwe-11) from misconfigured security policies in `security.yaml`.
* [A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures](/vulnerabilities/deserialization) from insecure deserialization of untrusted data.
