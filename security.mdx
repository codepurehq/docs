## Security Controls

### Authentication and Session 
#### Password Policy
Corgea's password policy is designed to prevent the use of weak passwords, which are a common vulnerability point in security systems. The policy includes several requirements:

- Personal Information Dissimilarity: Passwords must not be too similar to the user's personal information. This prevents easy guessing of passwords based on known user data.
- Minimum Length: Each password must contain at least 8 characters. Longer passwords generally equate to stronger security.
- Common Password Restriction: Passwords that are commonly used or easy to guess are prohibited. This includes passwords like "123456", "password", or "qwerty".
- Numeric Restriction: Passwords that are entirely numeric are not allowed, as numeric-only passwords are often easier to crack.
- Password Reset: Email's are required to verify a password change request.
- Corgea uses uses the PBKDF2 algorithm with a SHA256 hash, a password stretching mechanism recommended by NIST. 

#### Account Policy
Corgea's account policy is designed to prevent abuse and increase security:
- Email accounts can only be used once.
- User accounts are activated through email.
- Corgea reserves the right to terminate a user's account and a company's account

#### Rate Limiting
Corgea implements a limit on the number of requests a user can make within a certain timeframe. This is crucial in mitigating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and ensuring the system's availability for all users.

#### Authentication Brute-Force Prevention
This control is essential in safeguarding against attackers who attempt to gain unauthorized access by guessing passwords. After a certain number of failed login attempts, the account may be locked for a period of time, or the response time is deliberately slowed down.

#### Malicious Requests
Corgea uses a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that detects and mitigates malicious requests across all traffic. If any traffic is detected as suspicious, the WAF will intiatiate a Javascript challenge that the user must pass to access Corgea.

#### Session Expiration
Session expiration is a key aspect of session security in Corgea:

- Inactivity Timeout: User sessions are automatically terminated after a period of inactivity. This time period is carefully chosen to balance security with user convenience.
- Prevention of Unauthorized Access: This mechanism helps in preventing unauthorized access to a user's session, especially in scenarios where a user might forget to log out from a shared or public computer.
- Re-authentication Requirement: After session expiration, users are required to re-authenticate to ensure that the session is resumed securely.

### Web Security 
#### Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Protection
Measures to prevent attackers from injecting malicious scripts into web pages. Corgea escapes specific characters to prevent malicious input. 

#### Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection
Ensuring that requests made to a web application are from the authenticated user. CSRF protection works by checking for a secret in each POST request. This ensures that a malicious user cannot “replay” a form POST to your website and have another logged in user unwittingly submit that form. The malicious user would have to know the secret, which is user specific (using a cookie).

#### SQL Injection Protection
Safeguards against unauthorized database manipulations through SQL code injection. Queries in Corgea are protected from SQL injection since their queries are constructed using query parameterization. A query’s SQL code is defined separately from the query’s parameters. Since parameters may be user-provided and therefore unsafe, they are escaped by the underlying database driver.

#### Clickjacking Protection
Preventing attackers from tricking users into clicking on something different than what the user perceives. Corgea has clickjacking protection in the form of the X-Frame-Options middleware which in a supporting browser can prevent a site from being rendered inside a frame. 

#### Host Header Validation
Host header validation is crucial to ensure that HTTP requests are directed to the intended domain. 

### Data Security 
#### Data Collection
Corgea's approach to data collection focuses on gathering essential information while maintaining user privacy and security. The types of data collected include:

- Email Addresses: Used for account creation, communication, and notifications.
- First and Last Names: Collected to personalize user experience and for identification purposes in account management.
- IP Addresses: Gathered for security purposes, such as tracking login attempts and identifying potentially malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Information from SAST/SCA Tools: Includes details of vulnerabilities identified in the code during Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Software Composition Analysis (SCA).
- Code: Source code from users necessary for the operation of Corgea's services, such as code reviews and vulnerability scans.
- GitHub Access Tokens: Used to securely access repositories for code scanning and integration purposes.

#### Data Encryption In-Transit & At-Rest
Corgea ensures that all data, whether in transit or at rest, is securely encrypted:

In-Transit Encryption:
- Corgea redirects traffic from HTTP protocol (port 80) to HTTPS (port 443)
- Utilizes AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to manage and deploy SSL/TLS certificates.
- Employs TLS 1.3, the latest and most secure version of the TLS protocol, ensuring that data transmitted over the internet is encrypted and secure from interception or tampering.

At-Rest Encryption:
- Implements Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 256-bit key length for encrypting data at rest.
- AES-256 is a robust encryption standard, widely recognized for its strength and effectiveness in protecting data from unauthorized access.

#### Data Backups
To prevent data loss and ensure data availability, Corgea implements a comprehensive backup strategy:

- Daily Backups: Automated daily backups to capture and store the latest data, ensuring minimal data loss in case of system failures or data corruption.
- 30-Day Archive: Maintains a rolling 30-day archive of backups, providing a window for data recovery in case of delayed detection of data loss or corruption.
- AWS S3 / RDS Backups:
Utilizes Amazon S3 for secure and scalable storage of backup data.
Employs Amazon RDS Backups for database backup and recovery, taking advantage of its automated backup capabilities and point-in-time recovery features.

#### Non-Production environments
Non-production environments do not contain production data

### SDLC Controls
#### Security in SDLC
Corgea has integrated security into every stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to ensure that security is not an afterthought but a fundamental aspect of development:

- Threat Modeling during Design: In the design phase, threat modeling is conducted to identify potential security issues and create design strategies to mitigate these risks.
- Secure Coding Practices: Developers are trained and encouraged to follow secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities in the code.
- Regular Security Audits: Throughout the development process, regular security audits are performed to identify and rectify any security lapses.
- Security Testing before Deployment: Prior to deployment, comprehensive security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, is conducted to ensure the application is secure against known threats.

#### Code-Reviews
Corgea has instituted a rigorous code review process:

- Mandatory Peer Reviews: All code changes undergo mandatory peer reviews. This process involves thorough examination by fellow developers to identify any code issues, including potential security vulnerabilities.
- Checklists and Standards: Reviewers follow a checklist and adhere to established coding standards to ensure that nothing is overlooked during the review process.
- Feedback and Iteration: Feedback from code reviews is used for immediate improvements and as a learning tool for future development.

#### Supply-Chain Vulnerability Scanning during Code Merge
Corgea takes supply chain security seriously, particularly during the integration of new code from external sources:

- Automated Vulnerability Scanning: When new code is merged, automated tools scan for vulnerabilities that could be introduced from external libraries or dependencies.
- Continuous Monitoring: Continuous monitoring and scanning of the code base to identify any vulnerabilities that might arise over time due to changes in the external code or libraries used.

#### Secrets Scanning
To protect sensitive data, Corgea employs automated secrets scanning:

- Automated Detection: Tools are used to automatically scan the code repositories for unintended inclusion of secrets like passwords, API keys, and tokens.
- Immediate Alerts: When secrets are detected, immediate alerts are generated for rapid response to secure the exposed data.

#### SAST/SCA Code Scanning & Corgea for Security Fixes
Corgea's approach to code scanning and security fixes includes:

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST): This involves scanning the source code for potential security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
- Software Composition Analysis (SCA): SCA tools are used to analyze third-party components and open-source libraries for known vulnerabilities.
- Automated Security Fixes: Corgea integrates tools that not only identify vulnerabilities but also suggest or implement security fixes automatically, reducing the time to remediation.


### Infrastructure 
#### Cloud Infrastructure
Corgea leverages the power and flexibility of Amazon Web Services (AWS) for its cloud infrastructure needs. This choice provides a robust, scalable, and secure environment for hosting services and applications.


#### Cloud Infrastructure Security Practices
Corgea uses AWS security best practices, including VPCs, Security Groups, IAM roles, and will be conducting regular security assessments.

#### Shared responsibility model of cloud security
Corgea adheres to the AWS shared responsibility model, which delineates the security responsibilities between AWS and Corgea:

- Security "Of" the Cloud: AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all the services offered in the AWS Cloud.
- Security "In" the Cloud: Corgea's responsibility involves securing the content, platform, applications, systems, and networks they use on AWS.

#### Network segmentation and isolation
Corgea's approach to network segmentation and isolation is designed to enhance security and control:

- Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and Subnets: By using VPCs and subnets, Corgea effectively segments its network, isolating different parts of its infrastructure for specific purposes.
- Security Groups and Network ACLs: These are used to provide stateful and stateless filtering of traffic to and from resources.
- Service Communication Controls: Ensuring that services within Corgea's infrastructure communicate only with authorized counterparts, thus reducing the risk of internal threats and external breaches.

### Access controls
#### Access to Data
Corgea enforces strict access controls to ensure that staff access to data is limited and monitored:

- Restricted Data Access: Access to sensitive data is tightly controlled and is only permitted in specific circumstances, such as addressing production issues. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized data access or leaks.
- Infrastructure Access Control: Access to Corgea’s infrastructure is managed through a corporate Virtual Private Network (VPN). Our VPN provides a secure and encrypted connection, ensuring that access to internal resources is restricted to authorized personnel only.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implementation of RBAC to ensure that employees only have access to the information and resources necessary for their job functions.

#### Access Logs
Corgea maintains comprehensive access logs to track and audit access to its servers:

- WAF Logging: All server access is logged within our WAF. This includes information about who accessed the server, when the access occurred, and what actions were performed.
- Audit and Review: Regular audits of access logs are conducted to identify any unusual or unauthorized access patterns. This helps in quickly identifying and responding to potential security incidents.
- Transparency and Accountability: Keeping detailed access logs ensures transparency in access management and holds staff accountable for their actions within the infrastructure.
