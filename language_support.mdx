# Language and Framework Compatibility  

**Ensuring comprehensive code security across various programming languages, frameworks, and compliance with OWASP Top 10, SANS, and industry standards.**  

## Introduction  

Codepure is an advanced platform designed to deliver robust code security tailored to modern development needs. Supporting a wide array of programming languages and frameworks, Codepure identifies, mitigates, and auto-fixes vulnerabilities based on industry standards such as **OWASP Top 10**, **SANS/CWE Top 25**, and **PCI DSS 4.0**. With over 900 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) covered, Codepure seamlessly integrates into your development workflow, enhancing security, compliance, and efficiency.  

## Supported Programming Languages and Frameworks  

Codepure supports a diverse range of programming languages, enabling security scanning, false positive reduction, and automated issue resolution tailored to each ecosystem. Below are the currently supported languages and frameworks:  

### **C#**  

- **Language Insights**: Handles core constructs like LINQ, asynchronous programming (`async/await`), and generics.  
- **Frameworks**: .NET, ASP.NET Core, Blazor.  
- **Security Highlights**: Identifies vulnerabilities such as insecure deserialization, authentication flaws, and CSRF attacks. Aligns findings with OWASP A2 (Broken Authentication) and A8 (Insecure Deserialization).  

### **Python**  

- **Language Insights**: Supports Python-specific features, including decorators, context managers, and comprehensions.  
- **Frameworks**: Django, Flask, FastAPI.  
- **Security Highlights**: Addresses SQL injection (OWASP A1), XSS (A3), and insecure direct object references.  

### **Ruby**  

- **Language Insights**: Handles Ruby’s dynamic features, such as metaprogramming and blocks.  
- **Frameworks**: Ruby on Rails, Sinatra.  
- **Security Highlights**: Focuses on vulnerabilities like mass assignment (OWASP A4), unprotected routes, and insecure file uploads.  

### **Go (Golang)**  

- **Language Insights**: Analyzes Go-specific patterns like goroutines, channels, and interfaces.  
- **Frameworks**: Gin, Echo, Fiber.  
- **Security Highlights**: Identifies race conditions (SANS CWE-362), cryptographic misuse (SANS CWE-327), and improper error handling.  

### **JavaScript & TypeScript**  

- **Language Insights**: Comprehensive support for modern JavaScript and TypeScript, including asynchronous programming and TypeScript’s type system.  
- **Frameworks**: Node.js, Express.js, Next.js, NestJS, Angular, React, Vue.js.  
- **Security Highlights**: Detects prototype pollution (OWASP A5), insecure dependencies, and DOM-based XSS (OWASP A7).  

### **Java**  

- **Language Insights**: Supports features like annotations, generics, and lambda expressions.  
- **Frameworks**: Spring, Jakarta EE, Play Framework.  
- **Security Highlights**: Handles XXE attacks (OWASP A4), LDAP injection, and insecure deserialization (OWASP A8).  

### **PHP**  

- **Language Insights**: Comprehensive coverage of PHP’s unique syntax, including traits and attributes.  
- **Security Highlights**: Focuses on SQL injection (OWASP A1), remote code execution, and file inclusion vulnerabilities.  

### **Kotlin**  

- **Language Insights**: Tailored for Kotlin-specific features like null safety, coroutines, and extension functions.  
- **Security Highlights**: Ideal for Android and server-side development, addressing improper data exposure (OWASP A6) and insecure communication (OWASP A9).  

### **C & C++**  

- **Language Insights**: Delivers analysis for low-level programming constructs like pointers, templates, and memory management.  
- **Security Highlights**: Targets memory corruption vulnerabilities (SANS CWE-119), buffer overflows, and race conditions.
