Corgea's JIRA integration allows you to automatically create JIRA tickets for security issues found in your codebase. This integration streamlines the process of tracking and managing security vulnerabilities within your existing JIRA workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the JIRA integration, ensure that you have the following:

- A JIRA account with administrative privileges
- Your JIRA instance URL (e.g., `https://mycompany.atlassian.net`)
- A JIRA API token ([How to create a JIRA API token](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/))

## Setting up the Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Integrations Page">
    Log in to your Corgea account and navigate to the "Integrations" page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect JIRA">
    Locate the "JIRA" integration and click the "Add +" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Integration">
  ![Create JIRA Integration](/images/create-jira-integration.png)
    In the integration setup form, enter the following details:
    - **Name**: A friendly name for the integration (e.g., "My JIRA Instance")
    - **Base URL**: Your JIRA instance URL (e.g., `https://mycompany.atlassian.net`)
    - **Username**: Your JIRA username
    - **API Token**: Your JIRA API token
    - **Project Key** (optional): The default JIRA project key to use when creating issues
    - **Issue Type** (optional): The default JIRA issue type to use when creating issues
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Click "Save" to complete the integration setup.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating JIRA Issues

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Issues">
    Navigate to the "Issues" page in Corgea and select an issue for which you want to create a JIRA ticket.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Issue Details">
    On the issue details page, locate the "Create Ticket" button.
    ![Create Ticket Button](/images/create-ticket-button.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Ticket">
    If you haven't specified default values for the project key and issue type during the integration setup, you'll need to provide them here. Corgea will automatically fetch your projects and the issue types for you to select. 
    ![Create Ticket](/images/create-ticket.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Ticket">
    Click the "Create JIRA Ticket" button. Corgea will create a new JIRA issue with the relevant details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Creation">
    You'll receive a confirmation message with a link to the newly created JIRA ticket.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Customizing JIRA Ticket Details

By default, Corgea populates the JIRA ticket with the following information:

- **Summary**: The issue classification and file path (e.g., "CWE-022: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') in /app/routes.py").
- **Description**:
  - Vulnerability details (location, category, severity)
  - Issue explanation
  - Proposed fix (if available)
  - Link to the issue details page in Corgea

If you need to include additional fields or customize the ticket details, you can modify the JIRA ticket after it's created in your JIRA instance.

## Managing Multiple JIRA Integrations

If you have multiple JIRA instances or projects, you can set up multiple JIRA integrations in Corgea. When creating a JIRA ticket, you'll be prompted to select the appropriate integration to use.

By integrating Corgea with JIRA, you can streamline your security vulnerability management process and ensure that critical issues are tracked and addressed within your existing workflow.
