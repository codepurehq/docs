## Overview of Corgea
Corgea is an AI security platform that finds, triages and fixes insecure code. 

## How Corgea Works
Corgea's process involves several key steps:

1. Scanning: Corgea scans your code repositories using our [BLAST scanner](blast). For a more indepth explanation of BLAST, [read our whitepaper](https://corgea.com/blog/whitepaper-blast-ai-powered-sast-scanner).
2. Vulnerability Consumption: Corgea can also consume vulnerability reports from [integrated SAST tools](scanning#uploading-a-report).
3. Contextual Understanding: Corgea leverages [CodeIQ](https://corgea.com/blog/introducing-corgea-codeiq-smarter-detection-triaging-and-fixing-of-insecure-code) which provides it with extensive context for [CWEs](vulnerability_support) across languages & frameworks like [languages like Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript](language_support).
4. Issuing Fixes: Corgea issues fix suggestions for developers in [GitHub](github), [Azure DevOps](azure_devops) and IDE extensions ([VIsual Studio Code](vsc_extension) & [Visual Studio 2022](vs2022_extension))
