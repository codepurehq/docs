## Example Use Cases

Here are some example use cases for integrating Corgea with webhooks:

1. **Custom Notification Systems**: Send notifications to team communication tools when new vulnerabilities are discovered.

2. **Incident Management**: Trigger incident creation in systems like PagerDuty or OpsGenie.

3. **CI/CD Integration**: Send scan results to your build/deployment system.

4. **Custom Workflows**: Build custom automations by connecting with internal systems.

5. **Data Visualization**: Send data to tools like Grafana or Kibana for custom dashboards.

## Webhook Payload

When an event occurs, Corgea sends an HTTP POST request to your webhook URL containing relevant data about the event. The payload includes information such as:

- Event type
- Timestamp
- User who triggered the event
- Relevant event data (e.g., scan results, vulnerability details)

By leveraging webhook integrations in Corgea, you can create powerful automated workflows and seamlessly connect with your existing tools and services.
